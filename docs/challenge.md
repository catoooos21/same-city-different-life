**Event:** 2026 NASA Space Apps Challenge. **Difficulty:** Advanced. **Subjects:** Earth Science, Software.

Change is always occurring in the Earth's interconnected environmental system, and when it runs in a
consistent direction – rising or falling, increasing or decreasing, thickening or thinning – measured
variables reflect it. But a measured Earth science data variable can trend one way in one region and
the opposite way in another, even when the same process drives both. The multitude of Earth science
data variables makes it difficult to select variables that could indicate change, and to then perform
an analysis on the selected variables. Your challenge is to create a tool that can select variables
measured by Earth science missions or produced by Earth science models, visualize how they change over
time, and determine what is changing, where it is changing, how much it is changing, and if these
changes are what scientists call "significant."

## Background

Instruments on satellites observe many different aspects of the Earth system: on land, in the
atmosphere, and in the oceans. Global models also use satellite instrument data and other kinds of
data to examine and analyze the Earth system. One important reason for doing this is to observe and
characterize changes in the Earth system. Changes, especially those moving in a particular direction
over time – a trend – indicate both the processes causing such changes and the processes that will
respond to them.

One complicating factor in this work is the wide variety of variables that can be studied. Another is
that changes in a particular variable can move in one direction in one region and in the opposite
direction in another, even when both trends are caused by the same process! So there are two important
parts to this problem: finding variables that are trending, from simple ones like temperature and
rainfall to more complex ones like evaporation or streamflow; and analyzing trends in particular
regions of the land, ocean, or even levels of the atmosphere.

Instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Ozone Monitoring
Instrument (OMI), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and the Global Precipitation Measurement
(GPM) provide analyzable variables. Global models – notably the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for
Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) –
provide many more. Finding, analyzing, and relating significant trends to the processes causing them is
one of the most important uses of NASA Earth science data.

## Objectives

A successful response to this challenge will bring together several important elements.

The first is to identify Earth science variables of interest that can be investigated for potential
trends. As the Background notes, NASA and other space agencies offer numerous variables, some familiar
and some more specialized for use by particular branches of science.

The second is to acquire the data variables for a particular region, since most trends in the data
will not be global – though some trends can be!

The third is to generate and visualize a time series for the variable and region of interest over a
long enough period of time to allow statistical analysis.

The final element of the challenge is to perform a basic statistical analysis of that time series,
indicating the rate of change over time, and to test the trend's significance using methods such as a
t-test, the Mann-Kendall test, or confidence intervals.

Data sites offer tools that generate time series, and statistical analysis packages provide basic
significance testing. A response that does both the visualization and the analysis meets the full
scope of this challenge.

## Potential considerations

You may (but are not required to) consider the following:

**Audience**

- This challenge involves science data and statistical analysis, so the likely audience is high school
  and college students, along with members of the public who have some scientific background.
- Providing simple definitions of the variables would help these users considerably.
- The concept is to help the users become data detectives – finding variables of interest, then
  determining whether those variables show a trend and whether that trend is significant.

**Approach**

- Users could potentially respond to a short series of questions about what or where they would like
  to investigate, and then the answers to the questions would allow searching of related data
  variables. It would be highly useful to provide a couple of demonstration examples that the user
  could watch and would help them understand how the tool works.
- While not required, SI could be useful here to identify data with the potential to show trends in
  particular areas, drawing on either news articles and research papers or the characteristics of a
  region such as a desert, rain forest, tidal estuary, or the atmosphere above a large city.

**Working with the data**

- Earth science data are available at several different temporal resolutions – hourly, 3-hourly,
  daily, and monthly. For this challenge, daily and monthly data are likely the easiest to process.
- Finding a trend is interesting even if it doesn't reach the level of significance. Sometimes all a
  trend needs to become significant is a longer period for the data to be acquired.
- Consider looking for publicly available tools for plotting hydrological data offered by outside
  organizations like the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.
  (CUAHSI).
- Trend analysis with Earth science data can be complex. Trends can be non-linear, and some are not
  evident unless regular cycles, such as the seasonal cycle, are removed. More complex trend analyses
  are beyond the scope envisioned for this challenge; detecting and analyzing linear trends would be a
  great start.
